# Mysterious-Organism
This is a project on Codecademy that I am proud to have solved on my own.
It required the creation of a factory object for generating:
- unique specimen numbers,
- unique random strands of DNA,
- mutation of the first base in the strand and returning a new one,
- comparison of two different strands and calculation of how they match each other
- calculate the likelihood of their survival by matching their DNA bases against a corresponding %
- generate a complement strand by returning the counterpart for each base in the strand
As last, the project required the generation of 30 DNA strands of which the likelihood of survival returned true.
I have included the solution from Codecademy for anyone interested to check my provided solution against it.
