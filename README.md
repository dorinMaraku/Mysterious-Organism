# Mysterious-Organism
This is a project on Codecademy for which I am proud to have solved on my own.
It reuquired the creation of a factory object for generating:
- unique specimen numbers,
- unique random strands of DNA,
- mutation of the first base in the strand and returnin a new one,
- comparison of two different strands and calculate how they match to each other
- calculate the likleyhood of their survival by matching their DNA bases against a corresponding %
- generate a complement strand by by returning the counterpart for each base in the strand
As last, the project required to generate 30 strands of DNA of which the likelyhood to survive returned true.
I have included the solution from Codecademy for anyone interested to check my solution against it.
